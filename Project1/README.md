### Project 1: Foobar Strength Calculator

This project tracks and calculates the strength of mysterious creatures known as foobars. Each foobar can either be an ordinary foobar, a foo, or a bar, and their strength depends on their position in a line and their type. The program reads from an input file, processes foobars in a line, and outputs their names along with their calculated strengths. Object-oriented design principles are applied with a class hierarchy for foobars, foos, and bars, emphasizing practical implementation of inheritance and virtual functions in C++.
