### Project 3: Linked List Sorting

This project involves sorting the nodes of a linked list that stores data objects consisting of a last name, first name, and social security number (SSN). The program loads data from an input file, sorts the list based on last names (then first names, and then SSNs), and writes the sorted list to an output file. The project emphasizes sorting techniques and efficient manipulation of linked lists in C++ using the provided list class and standard sorting algorithms.
